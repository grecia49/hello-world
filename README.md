# hello-world
My space of creativity and learning ... Welcome :)
I have always been interested in the intersections in between practices. I am a chemical engineer that has merged studies with biotechnology and coding, and this has resulted in beautiful new studies never done before. I cannot be more amused by the exploration of knowledge and applying ideas from different fields to others.
I am taking a course on Coursera about Modern Art and yesterday I watched John Fish's video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCvUCjEKNiA&list=LLBqmP2S_T85kxK91A-HUsZw&index=2&t=0s). So I thought, let's give it a try, let's try to merge art and techniques with AI. I cannot wait to explore what I can come up with in here.

I would love to hear any feedback, recommendations or any comment you might want to add in here!

So let's get started :)


## hello, I have found more inspiration
https://aiartists.org/
I am impressed by how different neural networks can be developed to get different outputs. 
I am impressed by the distorsion of reality that AI gives. I still don't know how it works, but I am guessing a neural network can be trained (and constrained) depending on the data you feed into it, then this might be why the artist's different works look a bit all the same. Could I train it to not be trained?
I'm excited to see what will come out!
