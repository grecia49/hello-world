# hello-world
My space of creativity and learning ... Welcome :)
I have always been interested in the intersections in between practices. I am a chemical engineer that has merged studies with biotechnology and coding, and this has resulted in beautiful new studies never done before. I cannot be more amused by the exploration of knowledge and applying ideas from different fields to others.
Yesterday I watched John Fish's video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCvUCjEKNiA&list=LLBqmP2S_T85kxK91A-HUsZw&index=2&t=0s) and I cannot wait to explore what I can come up with in here.

I would love to hear any feedback, recommendations or any comment you might want to add in here!

So let's get started :)
